The purpose of this project is to explore and hone our skills in computer networking while also bringing to light a timely cultural issue in this era of COVID-19 and its impact on society. Ever since news about the virus began to surface, the Asian and especially Asian-American population has faced many challenges. This has come in the form of undeserving verbal racism and even aggressive physical altercations. As our team is made up of two students of Asian descent, we find close connection to this project and its cultural significance. Our project will feature a Twitter sentiment analysis using the Twitter API to track the sentiment about Asian people, culture, and perspective from before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to the current date. Our sentiment analysis will consist of taking individual tweets containing subjects or keywords directly related to Asian culture or people and giving a weighted score (positive or negative) based on the wording used in the tweet. It will also feature a website where the sentiment analysis can be observed alongside the past and current statistics of COVID-19 that will be updated in real-time. Asian culture and representation was at an all-time high during the last few years from the Hollywood blockbuster hit film “Crazy Rich Asians” (2018) to Andrew Yang as a possible 2020 presidential candidate. However, being that the outbreak of COVID-19 is traced back to Wuhan, China, many people of any Asian descent are being profiled and attacked. In this way, we expect that the current perspective of the Asian population is negative, but we want to provide insight into how much is due to the outbreak of COVID-19.
